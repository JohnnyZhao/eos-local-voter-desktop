# EOS Local Voter Desktop

## About

This is a desktop version of [eos-local-voter](https://github.com/eoslaomao/eos-local-voter)

It is built using Electron, which supports both Windows and Mac now. For Linux users, we recommend them run it from command line directly.

The main idea is this: Having a local server interact with remote API end point using official eosjs lib. This way, you can keep your key locally instead of submit it on some online voting portal. We think this is a much safer approach.

## TODO

1. Enable encryption between Desktop app and Local Server, which will lower the risk of sniffing from local malware.
2. Have code audited by 3rd party.
